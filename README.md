# open-race-scale
### Open Source Racecar Scale  
Four load cell scale controller for weighing cars using HX711 load cell module and Raspberry Pi platform. User interface will be via Bluetooth and smart phone app.
  
### Roadmap  
* Prototype electrical design as Raspberry Pi 3 Hat -> in progress  
* Create simple mechanical design for load cells -> in progress  
* Create Android/iOS app that will connect to the Rasberry Pi 3 to reccive live scale data (via bluetooth)  
* Add advanced features for storing weights for comparision  
* Add option of LCD screen directly on the Raspberry Pi 3  
* Get feedback and feature requests

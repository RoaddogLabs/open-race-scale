This is a Bluetooth LE dongle that transmits data from the scale pad to the mobile device.

There is no software or firmware at this time.  This is a reference design using an Adafruit Bluefruit nRF52 module and a Chenbo HX711 module.  This board uses pins A0 for the d_out from the HX711 and pin A1 for the S_CLK to the HX711.  If/when this changes in the software the board will be updated.
